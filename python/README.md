# Python

`counties.py` is just a straightforward, didactic implementation. Pretty looking and pretty slow. `counties_fast.py` changes the algorithm, and it's a lot faster.

```
$ time python3 counties.py
microspectrophotometries

real	0m3.145s
user	0m3.140s

$ time python3 counties_fast.py
microspectrophotometries

real	0m0.118s
