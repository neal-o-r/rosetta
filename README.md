Writing a simple algorithm in lots of languages.

The question is to take [this](https://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt) word list, and print out the longest word that shares at least one letter with 31 of the 32 Irish counties. The right answer is `microspectrophotometries` which is 24 letters long and shares at least one letter with every county except `Galway`.

The goal isn't to write the *best* implementation in each language, but to write the best version I can get working with a reasonable amount effort (including install and set up of the language), whilst following the path of least resistance.
